VALUES

All members of Alert Innovation practice the following values as part of their daily responsibilities and model these values as she/he leads or supports their teams.
The Golden Rule: Extraordinarily powerful in its simplicity and depth: “Treat others as you would want to be treated”.
The Power of Person: The contribution of every single person in a company is important, and the performance of the entire company can only be maximized when every person strives to achieve his/her full potential and to contribute to the best of his/her ability.
The Power of Team: The Power of Person becomes amplified exponentially when a group of people working effectively as a team create “performance synergy”, whereby the capacity to perform as a team is much greater than the sum of the individual members’ capacities.
The Power of Truth: We strive to see the world as it is, not as we want or imagine it to be, because only then can we make it better. This core value manifests itself through questioning, probing, testing, measuring, validating, verifying, proving, listening with an open mind, and making fact-based decisions. It also fosters transparency and honesty with others, as well as self-examination and self-honesty.
Alert Innovation is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.",,https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=2230&ao=562773&s=58&guid=0000016a3454d2da829b763bb8dc73e6&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_8f2f3167&cb=1555656391755&jobListingId=3071619952,"perl,r,c++","master,bs,ms"

VALUES

All members of Alert Innovation practice the following values as part of their daily responsibilities and model these values as she/he leads or supports their teams.
The Golden Rule: Extraordinarily powerful in its simplicity and depth: “Treat others as you would want to be treated”.
The Power of Person: The contribution of every single person in a company is important, and the performance of the entire company can only be maximized when every person strives to achieve his/her full potential and to contribute to the best of his/her ability.
The Power of Team: The Power of Person becomes amplified exponentially when a group of people working effectively as a team create “performance synergy”, whereby the capacity to perform as a team is much greater than the sum of the individual members’ capacities.
The Power of Truth: We strive to see the world as it is, not as we want or imagine it to be, because only then can we make it better. This core value manifests itself through questioning, probing, testing, measuring, validating, verifying, proving, listening with an open mind, and making fact-based decisions. It also fosters transparency and honesty with others, as well as self-examination and self-honesty.
Alert Innovation is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.",,https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=2817&ao=562773&s=58&guid=0000016a346dc690aa0a6fbaaa048811&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_9d165393&cb=1555657898258&jobListingId=3071619952,"perl,r,c++","master,bs,ms"

Our mission is to understand the Earth, including all of the economic and social trends impacting us. To do that we are building the best computer vision team in the world for large scale automated analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

To support this work we need creative and expert engineers who are not afraid of taking on computer vision problems that have never been tried before. They must be familiar with a broad range of techniques and able to research and utilize the best methods to complete the task. We also need them to never stop improving both the coverage and accuracy of the objects and kinds of land use that we can recognize.

The world is a very big place. With a single photograph of Earth, like the famous ""Blue Marble"" from Apollo 17, the entire world can fit on a computer screen. However, with this image you would not be able to see much detail. To see the Earth and all of its rich features, you would need a lot more images. In fact it would take over 500 million images just to observe the land area of Earth at 1 meter pixel resolution.

In order to see detail and work at scale, we use computer vision and machine learning. Using convolutional neural networks, we have counted over 3 billion cars across global roads and parking lots, analyzing commercial patterns as well as city growth and development. Our global energy product uses computer vision to map floating roof oil tanks and measure the global volumes of crude oil. With this product, we were able to show that China has 200 million barrels of oil storage capacity that was unknown even to the trading community. Other projects include tracking rates of deforestation, measuring poverty levels around the globe, monitoring construction rates of new roads and buildings, and predicting crop yields. This is still the beginning of our mission to understand the Earth.

Lead Computer Vision Scientist,Orbital Insight,"Palo Alto, CA","Our mission is to understand the Earth, including all of the economic and social trends impacting us. To do that we are building the best computer vision team in the world for large scale automated analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

To support this work we need creative and expert engineers who are not afraid of taking on computer vision problems that have never been tried before. They must be familiar with a broad range of techniques and able to research and utilize the best methods to complete the task. We also need them to never stop improving both the coverage and accuracy of the objects and kinds of land use that we can recognize.

The world is a very big place. With a single photograph of Earth, like the famous ""Blue Marble"" from Apollo 17, the entire world can fit on a computer screen. However, with this image you would not be able to see much detail. To see the Earth and all of its rich features, you would need a lot more images. In fact it would take over 500 million images just to observe the land area of Earth at 1 meter pixel resolution.

In order to see detail and work at scale, we use computer vision and machine learning. Using convolutional neural networks, we have counted over 3 billion cars across global roads and parking lots, analyzing commercial patterns as well as city growth and development. Our global energy product uses computer vision to map floating roof oil tanks and measure the global volumes of crude oil. With this product, we were able to show that China has 200 million barrels of oil storage capacity that was unknown even to the trading community. Other projects include tracking rates of deforestation, measuring poverty levels around the globe, monitoring construction rates of new roads and buildings, and predicting crop yields. This is still the beginning of our mission to understand the Earth.

Lead Computer Vision Scientist,Orbital Insight,"Palo Alto, CA","Our mission is to understand the Earth, including all of the economic and social trends impacting us. To do that we are building the best computer vision team in the world for large scale automated analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

To support this work we need creative and expert engineers who are not afraid of taking on computer vision problems that have never been tried before. They must be familiar with a broad range of techniques and able to research and utilize the best methods to complete the task. We also need them to never stop improving both the coverage and accuracy of the objects and kinds of land use that we can recognize.

The world is a very big place. With a single photograph of Earth, like the famous ""Blue Marble"" from Apollo 17, the entire world can fit on a computer screen. However, with this image you would not be able to see much detail. To see the Earth and all of its rich features, you would need a lot more images. In fact it would take over 500 million images just to observe the land area of Earth at 1 meter pixel resolution.

In order to see detail and work at scale, we use computer vision and machine learning. Using convolutional neural networks, we have counted over 3 billion cars across global roads and parking lots, analyzing commercial patterns as well as city growth and development. Our global energy product uses computer vision to map floating roof oil tanks and measure the global volumes of crude oil. With this product, we were able to show that China has 200 million barrels of oil storage capacity that was unknown even to the trading community. Other projects include tracking rates of deforestation, measuring poverty levels around the globe, monitoring construction rates of new roads and buildings, and predicting crop yields. This is still the beginning of our mission to understand the Earth.
