"Senior Software Engineer","BrandVerity","Seattle, WA","Senior Software Engineer

We are looking for a senior software engineer to tackle interesting data storage, access, and presentation problems and mentor others in a collaborative environment. This is all done in the context of a small but stable software business that values solving customer problems, challenging work, and fulfilling lives outside of work. Join our team as we find and root out evil on the Internet every day.

Our Challenges

We have two big challenges: collecting the right data from the web about brand and product content in context, and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers. We solve brand protection problems in online content in automated and creative ways.

The first piece is a big directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without having the resources to crawl the entire web. This involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.

The second piece is filtering the content we find for the customer. We use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future. For example, we’re using machine learning to predict how customers will categorize issues based on their previous reviews.

In some cases we are also detecting intentionally bad behavior, in a cat and mouse game to discover those bad (though intelligent) actors.

Join our team and help to address these challenges while learning cool new technologies! Grow your career in exploring challenging problem spaces like machine learning, big data and ‘simply’ writing responsive and elegant software that performs at enormous scale! Collaborate with like-minded developers who do all of this while working in a fun and dynamic environment!


Our Stack

All of this data collection and filtering requires intelligent data storage, primarily in non-relational data stores within AWS, including DynamoDB, Redis, and our column-oriented data store on top of S3. We also use Redshift and Redshift Spectrum (with Parquet/S3). We use MySQL in RDS for core relational data. We work in Python - it’s a versatile tool.

All of our heavy lifting is done within AWS, leveraging Chef and EC2 Autoscaling groups to handle changing loads without human intervention.

We have hired engineers from a variety of different backgrounds and have found that sharp engineers can identify shared concepts and quickly adapt to the new stack, so don’t worry if your background does not include some of these technologies.

"Sr Data Engineer","Q Bio","Redwood City, CA","Q Bio is a cross disciplinary team of doctors, scientists and engineers that believes the future of healthcare will be orders of magnitude more effective as it becomes truly data driven, preventative, and personalized. It is unlikely that our current system, bogged down by misaligned incentive structures, can be fixed in order to realize this potential. Therefore, we intend to reinvent it. The foundation of this new system will be tools that empower patients and their physicians to quantify, track, and analyze physiological changes in their bodies in unprecedented detail.

Our protocol is based on landmark systems biology research done at Stanford University. In an hour, we take blood, saliva, urine and a non-invasive whole-body scan from which we extract 1000s of genetic, chemical, and anatomical biomarkers to build the worlds most comprehensive quantitative snapshot of an individuals health at a point in time.

Q Bio was founded by Jeffrey Kaditz, serial entrepreneur and Founder of Affirm, Dr Michael Snyder, Chair of Genetics and Director of Personalized Medicine and Stanford University, and Dr Garry Choy, physician, radiologist, and former Chief Medical Information Officer at Mass General Hospital. We are fortunate to be backed by some of the best venture groups in the world including: A16Z, Khosla Ventures, Founders Fund, SciFi VC, and Kevin Durant.

In the past decade there has been an explosion in the tools available for the measurement and quantification of biological systems. Genomics was just the beginning. We are entering the age of full-stack, multi-scale biological digitization which will include Epigenomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics, Microbioimcs, Radiomics and more. Many of the tools to quantify our biology at these different layers of biological processes are improving faster than Moore's law on a price-performance basis. We seek exceptional highly motivated individuals who want to help us build the first platform capable of aggregating and analyzing all of this information in order to dramatically improve our ability to detect and predict the onset of disease in asymptomatic individuals.

The complexity of the problems I work on every day excite me. Tactical missile systems are not trivial, and are multi-threaded working at different rates. There are lots of interactions in the system, and lots of use cases that can go wrong if we aren't diligent to test all the boundaries. - KP

I may be testing software one day or the other day I might be writing software.

What excites about working at RMS /SEC every day is that I can be working on testing a program in C/C++, while next day I may be working on C++ GUI, or the day after in some other new programming language. I may be testing software one day or the other day I might be writing software. My point being here is that I'm always learning new things, new tasks and assignments all the time and that makes my job very interesting and fun. JS

People are here from all over the country and the world, and through that I've had a great time learning about other places and cultures. BP

Deep industry experience: 5+ years of software industry experience, showing a steady upward career progression in the art of Software Engineering.
Large scale delivery: It's hard building software, but even harder to maintain it, evolve it, and keep it awesome. You've done this for large-scale enterprise software.
High velocity engineering: You are used to and thrive in a high operational tempo. You've put out crazy fires and hit hard deadlines.
Distributed compute & big data: You've worked with distributed compute engines (Hadoop, Spark), and have been challenged by the performance challenges of large scale data.
Breadth of tools: Advanced software engineering skills, including the ability to write expert-level, maintainable, and robust code in a popular object oriented language like Scala, C++, Python, Java, etc.
Fostering the team: You love helping and mentoring others and showing leadership as an extraordinary hands-on developer and architect.

Introduction
ASML brings together the most creative minds in science and technology to develop lithography machines that are key to producing faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient microchips. We design, develop, integrate, market and service these advanced machines, which enable our customers - the world’s leading chipmakers - to reduce the size and increase the functionality of their microchips, which in turn leads to smaller, more powerful consumer electronics. Our main headquarters are located in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, and we also have 18 office locations around the United States- including main offices in Wilton, CT, Chandler, AZ, San Jose, CA and San Diego, CA.
Job Mission
The Development & Engineering Department in ASML Wilton office is currently searching for a talented software engineer to design and implement embedded software for systems among the highest precision ever produced in the world.
Job Description
As a software engineer at ASML you will be working on robotics, image processing, complex algorithms, GUI and application software.

After that you will be making a software design and document it using UML. All this is discussed and reviewed with your software team. A team of about 10 people consisting of a team lead, a sw architect, a few senior developers and a few junior developers. The Wilton branch has about 60 sw developers. ASML overall has about a 1000 sw developers. After your sw design is approved you are responsible for implementing the design in C for existing modules and C++ for new modules. A single module is roughly a 100.000 lines of code. Auto and unit testers are written in Python. After that is all reviewed you can go ahead and download the code to one of our lithography machines (which vary in price between 5 and 100 million dollar) and test the code. During the testing you will collect the necessary data so you can write a test report. This test report is then reviewed and when it is approved your software will be released. In a matter of days our customers will now be running with your software. The development environment is Red Hat Linux, execution environment is Wind River Linux.

The complexity of the problems I work on every day excite me. Tactical missile systems are not trivial, and are multi-threaded working at different rates. There are lots of interactions in the system, and lots of use cases that can go wrong if we aren't diligent to test all the boundaries. - KP

What excites about working at RMS /SEC every day is that I can be working on testing a program in C/C++, while next day I may be working on C++ GUI, or the day after in some other new programming language. I may be testing software one day or the other day I might be writing software. My point being here is that I'm always learning new things, new tasks and assignments all the time and that makes my job very interesting and fun. JS

More About Atara Bio:

Now in our sixth year, we’re proud of our team of 260+ Atarians co-located by design in South San Francisco (corporate headquarters) and Southern California (R&D and manufacturing headquarters in the northwest Los Angeles area) with a newly-established European headquarters in Zug, Switzerland. Atara also has a R&D site in the Denver, Colorado area and an office in New York City. Our Southern California hub is anchored by a new 90,000 sq. ft., state-of-the-art Atara T-Cell Operations and Manufacturing (ATOM) facility in Thousand Oaks, California.

One mission – “Transform the lives of patients with serious medical conditions through pioneering science, teamwork and expertise” – and a singular vision – “Cell therapy treatment for every patient, any time – provide inspiration and direction for all of us.”

The Company's off-the-shelf, allogeneic T-cells are bioengineered from donors with healthy immune function and allow for rapid delivery from inventory to patients without a requirement for pretreatment. Atara's T-cell immunotherapies are designed to precisely recognize and eliminate cancerous or diseased cells without affecting normal, healthy cells.

Atara's most advanced T-cell immunotherapy in development, tabelecleucel, or tab-cel™ (formerly known as ATA129), is being developed for the treatment of patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (EBV+ PTLD) who have failed rituximab, as well as other EBV-associated hematologic and solid tumors, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Tab-cel™ is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of EBV+ PTLD following an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (MATCH study) or solid organ transplant (ALLELE study).

Atara is also developing off-the-shelf, allogeneic ATA188 and autologous ATA190 T-cell immunotherapies using a complementary targeted antigen recognition technology for specific EBV antigens believed to be important for the potential treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). A Phase 1 clinical study of autologous ATA190 in patients with progressive MS is ongoing. Atara is also advancing a Phase 1 clinical study of ATA188 in patients with progressive or relapsing-remitting MS across clinical sites in the United States and Australia. Atara's clinical pipeline also includes ATA520 targeting Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) and ATA230 directed against cytomegalovirus (CMV).

Working at Atara Bio:

People at Atara Bio are high integrity, roll-up-your-sleeves, get-it-done types who are keenly committed to putting patients first, advancing medical care and doing so with demonstrated urgency. At their core Atarians are people who work well with others and are “team-centric”, have purposeful curiosity and can’t wait to save patient lives. And similar to other biotech companies who have so many accomplished people, we expect humility (we are a “low hubris” sort of place), flexibility, respect, teamwork, good judgment and getting the most out of any dollar we spend. We also expect to enjoy the journey (and each other) as we move forward with a shared responsibility to teach and to learn from what we do and from our teammates.

Why Work For Raytheon in the Software Engineering Center at RMS?
The complexity of the problems I work on every day excite me. Tactical missile systems are not trivial, and are multi-threaded working at different rates. There are lots of interactions in the system, and lots of use cases that can go wrong if we aren't diligent to test all the boundaries. - KP

What excites about working at RMS /SEC every day is that I can be working on testing a program in C/C++, while next day I may be working on C++ GUI, or the day after in some other new programming language. I may be testing software one day or the other day I might be writing software. My point being here is that I'm always learning new things, new tasks and assignments all the time and that makes my job very interesting and fun. JS
People are here from all over the country and the world, and through that I've had a great time learning about other places and cultures. BP
