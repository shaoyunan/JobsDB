This is key position in a collaborative, entrepreneurial, small company environment with unlimited potential to grow. It is an exceptional opportunity for someone who works hard and wants to be noticed, because your performance will have an immediate and obvious impact on our success.

You will be instrumental in creating our industry-leading software. Our most recent customer just paid a cancellation fee to get out of a contract with their previous software provider, just so they could get started sooner with Acordex software! Our next product seeks to reduce the number of trucks on the road by making freight operations more efficient. If we can help a company with 50 trucks get their work done with 49 trucks, we will save that customer $180,000 per year and reduce their carbon footprint by about 90 tons of CO2 per year. Everyone wins, and we need your help to accomplish it!

You will coordinate the work of the engineering staff, implement project priorities, write software for some of your own projects, interact with customers and quickly become a key decision maker for the company. Depending on experience, you will start with or take on hiring responsibilities.

Acordex offers a friendly, collaborative work environment. You're always welcome to walk into the office of the president.

"Senior Software Engineer","BrandVerity","Seattle, WA","Senior Software Engineer

We are looking for a senior software engineer to tackle interesting data storage, access, and presentation problems and mentor others in a collaborative environment. This is all done in the context of a small but stable software business that values solving customer problems, challenging work, and fulfilling lives outside of work. Join our team as we find and root out evil on the Internet every day.

Our Challenges

We have two big challenges: collecting the right data from the web about brand and product content in context, and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers. We solve brand protection problems in online content in automated and creative ways.

The first piece is a big directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without having the resources to crawl the entire web. This involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.

The second piece is filtering the content we find for the customer. We use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future. For example, we’re using machine learning to predict how customers will categorize issues based on their previous reviews.

In some cases we are also detecting intentionally bad behavior, in a cat and mouse game to discover those bad (though intelligent) actors.

Join our team and help to address these challenges while learning cool new technologies! Grow your career in exploring challenging problem spaces like machine learning, big data and ‘simply’ writing responsive and elegant software that performs at enormous scale! Collaborate with like-minded developers who do all of this while working in a fun and dynamic environment!


Our Stack

All of this data collection and filtering requires intelligent data storage, primarily in non-relational data stores within AWS, including DynamoDB, Redis, and our column-oriented data store on top of S3. We also use Redshift and Redshift Spectrum (with Parquet/S3). We use MySQL in RDS for core relational data. We work in Python - it’s a versatile tool.

All of our heavy lifting is done within AWS, leveraging Chef and EC2 Autoscaling groups to handle changing loads without human intervention.

We have hired engineers from a variety of different backgrounds and have found that sharp engineers can identify shared concepts and quickly adapt to the new stack, so don’t worry if your background does not include some of these technologies.

We want you to have time to do the things that are important to you outside of work and come to work refreshed and inspired with your best ideas. To that end, we keep reasonable working hours and have an unlimited vacation policy.

Software Engineer - C and PHP
Portland, Oregon

Your Opportunity

The PHP & C Agents team is looking for a software engineer to help us build lightweight, rock-solid monitoring software that our customers trust enough to put into their production applications. Our primary responsibilities are building and supporting the PHP Agent and the C SDK, ensuring that our customers get accurate performance data for their PHP and Linux applications.

Our code runs inside hundreds of thousands of our customers’ applications and services. We have no control over the hosts and environments our code runs in. Even so, our customers depend on it being 100% reliable and having minimal performance impact.

We’re a small, close-knit team. We work together, obsess over quality, and laugh a lot.

Opportunity to work from a remote office may be available depending on your location.

What You’ll Do
Hack into the PHP interpreter and manipulate bytecode
Craft and refine API methods for our C SDK
Develop exporters for New Relic data that plug into existing open source projects
Work with the monitoring community to create industry-wide tracing standards
Delight our customers by adding support for their favorite framework
Interact directly with our customers via GitHub
Write internal blog posts to share information with other teams
Unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, cross-agent testing…
Take turns as the team’s “support hero”: heroically helping our Support team with especially tricky customer issues, and heroically protecting the rest of the team from interruption

Your Qualifications

Must-have:
Accountability: We never say something is “not our problem”. If it’s our customer’s problem, it is our problem, too. We never drop the ball.
Attention to detail: We do excellent work, every time. We never half-ass anything. We help each other strive for this excellence.
C experience: Our PHP Agent is primarily written in C. Our C SDK is written entirely in C. Experience in C is essential.
Collaboration: We work closely together. We say “we” rather than “I”. We share information and help each other to do our best work. We appreciate each other and celebrate our successes.
Strong Communication: Being an autonomous team in a larger organization, with all teams working well together, requires strong communication. We write proposals, specs, and retrospectives. We give talks, and we demo the work we are doing.
“Second Job”: Our “first job” is the job we were hired for (all of the above). Our “second job” is helping those around us to succeed at their jobs. Balancing first and second jobs makes us smarter, more effective, and happier.
Nice-to-have:
PHP experience: We instrument PHP applications and frameworks with our agent. PHP knowledge helps the team determine which code paths are most important to instrument.
Go experience: The PHP Agent has a daemon that is written in Go.
Windows experience: We have customers that want to use our C SDK in Windows environments.

Software Engineer - C and PHP
Portland, Oregon

Your Opportunity

The PHP & C Agents team is looking for a software engineer to help us build lightweight, rock-solid monitoring software that our customers trust enough to put into their production applications. Our primary responsibilities are building and supporting the PHP Agent and the C SDK, ensuring that our customers get accurate performance data for their PHP and Linux applications.

Our code runs inside hundreds of thousands of our customers’ applications and services. We have no control over the hosts and environments our code runs in. Even so, our customers depend on it being 100% reliable and having minimal performance impact.

We’re a small, close-knit team. We work together, obsess over quality, and laugh a lot.

Opportunity to work from a remote office may be available depending on your location.

What You’ll Do
Hack into the PHP interpreter and manipulate bytecode
Craft and refine API methods for our C SDK
Develop exporters for New Relic data that plug into existing open source projects
Work with the monitoring community to create industry-wide tracing standards
Delight our customers by adding support for their favorite framework
Interact directly with our customers via GitHub
Write internal blog posts to share information with other teams
Unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, cross-agent testing…
Take turns as the team’s “support hero”: heroically helping our Support team with especially tricky customer issues, and heroically protecting the rest of the team from interruption

Your Qualifications

Must-have:
Accountability: We never say something is “not our problem”. If it’s our customer’s problem, it is our problem, too. We never drop the ball.
Attention to detail: We do excellent work, every time. We never half-ass anything. We help each other strive for this excellence.
C experience: Our PHP Agent is primarily written in C. Our C SDK is written entirely in C. Experience in C is essential.
Collaboration: We work closely together. We say “we” rather than “I”. We share information and help each other to do our best work. We appreciate each other and celebrate our successes.
Strong Communication: Being an autonomous team in a larger organization, with all teams working well together, requires strong communication. We write proposals, specs, and retrospectives. We give talks, and we demo the work we are doing.
“Second Job”: Our “first job” is the job we were hired for (all of the above). Our “second job” is helping those around us to succeed at their jobs. Balancing first and second jobs makes us smarter, more effective, and happier.
Nice-to-have:
PHP experience: We instrument PHP applications and frameworks with our agent. PHP knowledge helps the team determine which code paths are most important to instrument.
Go experience: The PHP Agent has a daemon that is written in Go.
Windows experience: We have customers that want to use our C SDK in Windows environments.


Please note that visa sponsorship is not available for this position.

We’re looking for a Software / Integration engineer contract (6 months we would be strongly considering contract to hire at the end of 6 months) who loves tying systems together in ways that just work, can be extended easily, and minimize the need for upkeep.

Improving the operation and maintenance of our existing integration systems through iterative upgrades, streamlining, and adoption of a standard methodology
Supporting company-level initiatives for transforming New Relic business processes
Serving as a solution advisor and partner to all of New Relic’s business departments, as well as leading the design and delivery of these solutions
Providing integration expertise and leadership to the New Relic Product Engineering team
Mentoring and training team members on design and architecture best practices
Exemplifying New Relic’s core values of being bold, passionate, accountable, connected, and authentic
How to know if you're right for this role:
You have excellent written and verbal communication skills and an interest in understanding the real needs that drive requirements
You have 4+ years of demonstrated expertise in designing, implementing, and supporting innovative Enterprise integration solutions and meeting business requirements
You can offer meaningful perspectives on the latest thinking around integration design patterns, concepts, alternatives, and best practices
You've used SaaS or enterprise integration tools, including Mulesoft, Boomi, and/or Informatica
You've built solutions integrating across enterprise SaaS systems, including Salesforce (Force.com), Zuora, Workday, NetSuite, Marketo, and/or ZenDesk
You have experience developing, profiling, and troubleshooting Java application, including experience with JEE, JMS, and Tomcat
You have experience designing, developing, and deploying public and private APIs using SOAP and REST
You have data management experience including SQL tools like MySQL and Postgres, as well as experience with data warehouse systems
You're proficient in modern SaaS dev ops and CI/CD tools and operating environments, such as Maven, Gradle, Jenkins, Github, AWS, Heroku, etc.
You're familiar with agile methodologies for enterprise SDLC across service development, security, deployment, maintenance, operations, monitoring, and updates
You have knowledge of enterprise architecture frameworks, such as TOGAF
You've likely earned a CS or Engineering Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree (but know that having experience with, and a passion for, designing creative integration solutions is more important)

New Relic is looking for a passionate engineer to join our Data Platform team, developing the high-performance, big data components that power New Relic's world-class suite of software analytics products.

If you love scale and want to contribute to one of the largest and fastest growing big data platforms in the world we’d love to hear from you. If the idea of working on systems that process millions of messages per second and handle petabytes of data excites you, then you may be exactly what we're looking for.

In general, New Relic's engineering culture emphasizes team autonomy. This means that the team gets to choose how it does work, and what it works on (as long as this is generally aligned with the business' priorities); it also means that we work to reduce dependencies between teams, allowing a team to work at optimal velocity without blocking on others.

Examples of what you'll work on:
Developing the custom database technologies that power New Relic's advanced analytics querying capabilities.
Developing our next generation of highly available multi-region data storage.
Improving our deployment and testing automation pipelines to ensure we can continue to move quickly and with confidence.
What working on this team is like:
We work with some of the smartest, nicest people you'll meet. People who work here say the problems they work on are enormously challenging, and that the team culture is the most supportive they've seen.
We like pairing/mobbing but are not dogmatic about it. Pairing is a tool, not a lifestyle.
We're a confederacy of peers. We all work together on design decisions, testing methodologies, etc.
Our customers are our fellow engineers, so we have easy access to feedback. We experience the impact our work is having. We take pride in providing services with great availability and ease of use.
New Relic is growing and adding new products to our platform at a steady rate. This means our services need to be accessible and easy to use. We'll be connected to both new and established teams consuming our services.
We own everything about our services from concept through to operations and support. We invest in keeping our operational overhead to a minimum while still being dependable and responsive to support needs.
We ship incrementally and often. Once we merge code we normally want to ship it straight away.
We own our process and we're free to improve on it.
How do you know if you're right for this job?
You've built services or applications where performance is an important consideration
You've worked in threaded environments and understand the benefits and pitfalls of these concurrency primitives
You understand the value that builds and test automation brings to a development team's efficiency and reliability and are passionate about applying these techniques to your projects
You’ve worked with Kafka or other message queueing systems in a high throughput environment
DevOps experience is a bonus
Please note, this position is not eligible for visa sponsorship.

In addition, you’ll help lead gamedays that test the limits our systems, provide capacity planning, and generally support systems with an eye for long term health.

In general, New Relic's engineering culture emphasizes team autonomy. This means that the team gets to choose how it does work, and what it works on (as long as this is generally aligned with the business' priorities); it also means that we work to reduce dependencies between teams, allowing a team to work at optimal velocity without blocking on others.

Typically, Software Engineers with this skill set have shipped and want to continue to develop production, 24x7, high-quality back-end services.


Requirements:
Knowledge of service-oriented architectures and web services best practices.
Understanding of principles for good API Design.
Being an excellent Java/Ruby/Go programmer.
Serious about testing and building high quality software systems.
Previous experience with high throughput engineering is preferred.

The Power of Team: The Power of Person becomes amplified exponentially when a group of people working effectively as a team create “performance synergy”, whereby the capacity to perform as a team is much greater than the sum of the individual members’ capacities.
The Power of Truth: We strive to see the world as it is, not as we want or imagine it to be, because only then can we make it better. This core value manifests itself through questioning, probing, testing, measuring, validating, verifying, proving, listening with an open mind, and making fact-based decisions.

The Golden Rule: Extraordinarily powerful in its simplicity and depth: “Treat others as you would want to be treated”.

The Power of Team: The Power of Person becomes amplified exponentially when a group of people working effectively as a team create “performance synergy”, whereby the capacity to perform as a team is much greater than the sum of the individual members’ capacities.
The Power of Truth: We strive to see the world as it is, not as we want or imagine it to be, because only then can we make it better. This core value manifests itself through questioning, probing, testing, measuring, validating, verifying, proving, listening with an open mind, and making fact-based decisions. It also fosters transparency and honesty with others, as well as self-examination and self-honesty.

VALUES

All members of Alert Innovation practice the following values as part of their daily responsibilities and model these values as she/he leads or supports their teams.
The Golden Rule: Extraordinarily powerful in its simplicity and depth: “Treat others as you would want to be treated”.
The Power of Person: The contribution of every single person in a company is important, and the performance of the entire company can only be maximized when every person strives to achieve his/her full potential and to contribute to the best of his/her ability.
The Power of Team: The Power of Person becomes amplified exponentially when a group of people working effectively as a team create “performance synergy”, whereby the capacity to perform as a team is much greater than the sum of the individual members’ capacities.
The Power of Truth: We strive to see the world as it is, not as we want or imagine it to be, because only then can we make it better. This core value manifests itself through questioning, probing, testing, measuring, validating, verifying, proving, listening with an open mind, and making fact-based decisions. It also fosters transparency and honesty with others, as well as self-examination and self-honesty.
Alert Innovation is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.

VALUES

All members of Alert Innovation practice the following values as part of their daily responsibilities and model these values as she/he leads or supports their teams.
The Golden Rule: Extraordinarily powerful in its simplicity and depth: “Treat others as you would want to be treated”.
The Power of Person: The contribution of every single person in a company is important, and the performance of the entire company can only be maximized when every person strives to achieve his/her full potential and to contribute to the best of his/her ability.
The Power of Team: The Power of Person becomes amplified exponentially when a group of people working effectively as a team create “performance synergy”, whereby the capacity to perform as a team is much greater than the sum of the individual members’ capacities.
The Power of Truth: We strive to see the world as it is, not as we want or imagine it to be, because only then can we make it better. This core value manifests itself through questioning, probing, testing, measuring, validating, verifying, proving, listening with an open mind, and making fact-based decisions. It also fosters transparency and honesty with others, as well as self-examination and self-honesty.
Alert Innovation is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.","","https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=2230&ao=562773&s=58&guid=0000016a3454d2da829b763bb8dc73e6&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_8f2f3167&cb=1555656391755&jobListingId=3071619952"

Why Work For Raytheon in the Software Engineering Center at RMS?
The complexity of the problems I work on every day excite me. Tactical missile systems are not trivial, and are multi-threaded working at different rates. There are lots of interactions in the system, and lots of use cases that can go wrong if we aren't diligent to test all the boundaries. - KP

What excites about working at RMS /SEC every day is that I can be working on testing a program in C/C++, while next day I may be working on C++ GUI, or the day after in some other new programming language. I may be testing software one day or the other day I might be writing software. My point being here is that I'm always learning new things, new tasks and assignments all the time and that makes my job very interesting and fun. JS

Why Work For Raytheon in the Software Engineering Center at RMS?
The complexity of the problems I work on every day excite me. Tactical missile systems are not trivial, and are multi-threaded working at different rates. There are lots of interactions in the system, and lots of use cases that can go wrong if we aren't diligent to test all the boundaries. KP

What excites about working at RMS /SEC every day is that I can be working on testing a program in C/C++, while next day I may be working on C++ GUI, or the day after in some other new programming language. I may be testing software one day or the other day I might be writing software. My point being here is that I'm always learning new things, new tasks and assignments all the time and that makes my job very interesting and fun. JS

VALUES

All members of Alert Innovation practice the following values as part of their daily responsibilities and model these values as she/he leads or supports their teams.
The Golden Rule: Extraordinarily powerful in its simplicity and depth: “Treat others as you would want to be treated”.
The Power of Person: The contribution of every single person in a company is important, and the performance of the entire company can only be maximized when every person strives to achieve his/her full potential and to contribute to the best of his/her ability.
The Power of Team: The Power of Person becomes amplified exponentially when a group of people working effectively as a team create “performance synergy”, whereby the capacity to perform as a team is much greater than the sum of the individual members’ capacities.
The Power of Truth: We strive to see the world as it is, not as we want or imagine it to be, because only then can we make it better. This core value manifests itself through questioning, probing, testing, measuring, validating, verifying, proving, listening with an open mind, and making fact-based decisions. It also fosters transparency and honesty with others, as well as self-examination and self-honesty.
Alert Innovation is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.","","https://www.glassdoor.com/partner/jobListing.htm?pos=2817&ao=562773&s=58&guid=0000016a346dc690aa0a6fbaaa048811&src=GD_JOB_VIEW&t=SR&vt=w&cs=1_9d165393&cb=1555657898258&jobListingId=3071619952"

"Software Engineer","Stride Consulting","New York, NY","Join our Family

Stride Consulting is a mission-driven, engineering-centric company. We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you'll be in great company.

Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them. We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients' development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.

We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.

As a Strider, you'll find a learning opportunity that's unmatched. You will:
Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and has won Crain's Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.
Write high quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.
Immerse yourself in a learning journey that's second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.
Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.
Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer

You'll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.

You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here's how one day might unfold:

9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I'm noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager's take. We walk away with action items for next week's one-on-one.

10am: Daily Standup. I'm at work at the client's office. They've got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I'm on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we're off to code.

10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I'm pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.

12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride

12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride's got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I'm psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.

1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client's office.

1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we're retrospecting our last release. I've never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.

2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I've been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it's been a huge career learning experience for me.

6pm: Leave for the Day. It's been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.

What you'll be doing

Your job: write high quality code, and bring a 'teach a team to fish' mentality to your project. You will:
Embed with development teams in some of NYC's most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.
Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.
Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).
Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams. We embed with teams who write code in modern tech stacks such as Ruby on Rails, React, Angular, Python, Scala, Java8, Elixir, Node and more.
You're a fit for Stride if you have:
3+ years of software development experience
Experience in multiple programming languages
Excitement to learn new languages and frameworks
Experience with TDD, story estimation, test writing, and pair programming
What you can expect from us:
Continuous learning on things that you are passionate about

Empowerment to work at a self-defined Sustainable Pace
