"Computer Vision Scientist","Orbital Insight","Palo Alto, CA","Computer Vision Scientist

Our mission is to understand the Earth, including all of the economic and social trends impacting us. To do that we are building the best computer vision team in the world for large scale automated analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

To support this work we need creative and expert engineers who are not afraid of taking on computer vision problems that have never been tried before. They must be familiar with a broad range of techniques and able to research and utilize the best methods to complete the task. We also need them to never stop improving both the coverage and accuracy of the objects and kinds of land use that we can recognize.

The world is a very big place. With a single photograph of Earth, like the famous ""Blue Marble"" from Apollo 17, the entire world can fit on a computer screen. However, with this image you would not be able to see much detail. To see the Earth and all of its rich features, you would need a lot more images. In fact it would take over 500 million images just to observe the land area of Earth at 1 meter pixel resolution.

In order to see detail and work at scale, we use computer vision and machine learning. Using convolutional neural networks, we have counted over 3 billion cars across global roads and parking lots, analyzing commercial patterns as well as city growth and development. Our global energy product uses computer vision to map floating roof oil tanks and measure the global volumes of crude oil. With this product, we were able to show that China has 200 million barrels of oil storage capacity that was unknown even to the trading community. Other projects include tracking rates of deforestation, measuring poverty levels around the globe, monitoring construction rates of new roads and buildings, and predicting crop yields. This is still the beginning of our mission to understand the Earth.

This position is based in Palo Alto, CA.

Job Duties
Design and implement highly scalable computer vision algorithms
Rapidly iterate algorithms to continuously improve precision and recall under a variety of conditions
Collaborate with end-user product owners to understand computer vision needs
Design and implement test methodologies for testing and accuracy assessment
Support build deployment, management, and monitoring systems
Provide production support for applications and infrastructure
Skills & Qualifications
MS or higher in computer science or related discipline

"Lead Computer Vision Scientist","Orbital Insight","Palo Alto, CA","Our mission is to understand the Earth, including all of the economic and social trends impacting us. To do that we are building the best computer vision team in the world for large scale automated analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

To support this work we need creative and expert engineers who are not afraid of taking on computer vision problems that have never been tried before. They must be familiar with a broad range of techniques and able to research and utilize the best methods to complete the task. We also need them to never stop improving both the coverage and accuracy of the objects and kinds of land use that we can recognize.

The world is a very big place. With a single photograph of Earth, like the famous ""Blue Marble"" from Apollo 17, the entire world can fit on a computer screen. However, with this image you would not be able to see much detail. To see the Earth and all of its rich features, you would need a lot more images. In fact it would take over 500 million images just to observe the land area of Earth at 1 meter pixel resolution.

In order to see detail and work at scale, we use computer vision and machine learning. Using convolutional neural networks, we have counted over 3 billion cars across global roads and parking lots, analyzing commercial patterns as well as city growth and development. Our global energy product uses computer vision to map floating roof oil tanks and measure the global volumes of crude oil. With this product, we were able to show that China has 200 million barrels of oil storage capacity that was unknown even to the trading community. Other projects include tracking rates of deforestation, measuring poverty levels around the globe, monitoring construction rates of new roads and buildings, and predicting crop yields. This is still the beginning of our mission to understand the Earth.

This position is based in Palo Alto, CA.

"Lead Computer Vision Scientist","Orbital Insight","Palo Alto, CA","Our mission is to understand the Earth, including all of the economic and social trends impacting us. To do that we are building the best computer vision team in the world for large scale automated analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

To support this work we need creative and expert engineers who are not afraid of taking on computer vision problems that have never been tried before. They must be familiar with a broad range of techniques and able to research and utilize the best methods to complete the task. We also need them to never stop improving both the coverage and accuracy of the objects and kinds of land use that we can recognize.

The world is a very big place. With a single photograph of Earth, like the famous ""Blue Marble"" from Apollo 17, the entire world can fit on a computer screen. However, with this image you would not be able to see much detail. To see the Earth and all of its rich features, you would need a lot more images. In fact it would take over 500 million images just to observe the land area of Earth at 1 meter pixel resolution.

In order to see detail and work at scale, we use computer vision and machine learning. Using convolutional neural networks, we have counted over 3 billion cars across global roads and parking lots, analyzing commercial patterns as well as city growth and development. Our global energy product uses computer vision to map floating roof oil tanks and measure the global volumes of crude oil. With this product, we were able to show that China has 200 million barrels of oil storage capacity that was unknown even to the trading community. Other projects include tracking rates of deforestation, measuring poverty levels around the globe, monitoring construction rates of new roads and buildings, and predicting crop yields. This is still the beginning of our mission to understand the Earth.

This position is based in Palo Alto, CA.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs. Vital to igniting growth. Vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future of billions around the globe.

But, Innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees have lots of ideas on how to improve a business, but with no formal process, their suggestions go unheard and they give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation labs are expected to support countless different activities to promote innovation but lack the right tools for the job. Executives are seeing disruption everywhere they look and investing millions, but still have no idea where their “next big thing” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a platform that’s solving those problems. We’ve been helping corporate R&D teams be more efficient with the 1.5 Trillion dollars invested annually.

"Mathematical and Computational Scientist","Geisinger","Danville, PA","JOB TITLE: Mathematical and Computational Scientist

LOCATION: Center for Health Research

DEPARTMENT: Research

WORK SCHEDULE: Days

WORK TYPE: Full Time

JOB SUMMARY:

Geisinger Health System’s Neuroscience Institute is seeking early-career investigators with a strong background in computational intelligence as well as a creative and innovative approach to applied data analytics for a position as an early career investigator with its newly-developed Mathematical and Computational Neurosciences Research Group. This group will be directed by a clinical neurosurgeon with academic interest and experience in data science and predictive analytics who is tasked with developing novel methods to use complex, integrated healthcare datasets to individualize and to optimize the care of patients with neurologic disease. The team will work collaboratively on joint projects and will leverage the unique talents of its individual members to develop data models that can be directly and promptly implemented in a clinical setting to improve patient care.

The group will be based at Geisinger’s newly-developed Center for High Performance Medical Computing. In addition to individual high-performance workstations, the investigator will have unencumbered access to a new computational cluster with 384 CPU cores / 32 GPUs / 2.2 TB RAM running RedHat LINUX and a high-performance storage server with 248TB of disk storage running Hadoop and SQL databases over a GPFS file system. Matlab and Matlab DCS are deployed on this cluster, as are most other standard scientific and mathematical computing software packages.

As a member of the Mathematical and Computational Neurosciences Research Group, the investigator (and the remainder of the team) will be supported by a scientific programmer dedicated to the operations of the research group as well as by a computational cluster administrator and a database programmer who are dedicated full-time to the Center for High Performance Medical Computing. These resources will prevent the investigator from having to spend valuable time performing system administration or routine programming tasks and will instead allow their unique skills to be focused exclusively on the research group’s academic mission of investigation and development.

The projects that the group will undertake will involve using heterogeneous, large-volume databases (including clinical, imaging, molecular, and economic data) in conjunction with current and novel predictive analytics methods to individualize the delivery of healthcare, to optimize patient management strategies, to provide data-driven decision support to clinicians treating patients with neurologic disease, and to address challenges associated with efficiency of the process of healthcare delivery on an institutional level. The machine learning / computational intelligence investigator will focus specifically on building algorithms that are capable of learning and improving in response to the real-time data stream that is continuously generated during the routine course of clinical practice in a large academic medical center.

As an integral part of the research team who is critical to the hypothesis generation and innovation processes, the investigator will also have opportunities to interface with the clinical / patient care environment. The investigator will be encouraged to attend tumor boards, outpatient clinics, and selected inpatient medical and surgical activities in order to better understand the nature of the questions needing to be addressed and of the environment in which the models and tools developed by the group will be implemented.

Considerable emphasis is placed on practical implementation of the strategies, tools, and techniques developed by the group, making this more than just a traditional academic research engagement. While publications, presentations, and other standard research metrics will be part of the ongoing assessment of the investigator’s performance, significant value will also be placed on the practical utility and successful clinical implementation of the models and tools developed by the group. Together, these characteristics represent a unique opportunity for a machine learning investigator with a strong interest in real-world medical applications of data science.

This position reports directly to the clinician / data scientist who serves in the dual roles of (1) director of the Mathematical and Computational Neurosciences Research Group, and (2) co-director of the Center for High-Performance Medical Computing.

COMPETENCIES AND SKILLS:

• Proficiency with the theory and applications of common machine learning and computational intelligence algorithms, strategies, and methods

• Proficiency with coding machine learning / computational intelligence applications in common mathematical / scientific computing languages (e.g. Matlab, R)

• Proficiency with predictive analytic methods, including data modeling and regression methods

• Experience writing and publishing academic manuscripts in domain-relevant journals

• Fluency in writing and speaking the English language

• Creative and innovative thinking with a focus on novel approaches to solving computational and analytic challenges

• An interest in working collaboratively and contributing intellectually to a team of physicians, mathematicians, and programmers working to apply complex analytic methods to clinically-relevant problems related to optimizing patient care

• Experience / Proficiency with developing and testing machine learning / computational intelligence methods in a distributed / parallel computing environment

• Experience / Proficiency with methods for dimensionality reduction

• Experience / Proficiency with classification, including kernel-based classifiers

• Experience / Proficiency with real-time data stream analysis

• Experience / Proficiency with model-based optimization problems and applications

• Experience / proficiency with advanced statistics

• Experience / Proficiency with developing graphical user interfaces (stand-alone and web-based) that facilitate straightforward application of machine learning models.

• Experience writing academic grants and/or securing external funding

We dont try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we dont hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline in terms they can understand why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. Were not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but heres a suggestion if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.

"Mathematical and Computational Scientist","Geisinger Health System","Danville, PA","*JOB TITLE:** Mathematical and Computational Scientist
*LOCATION:** Center for Health Research
*DEPARTMENT:** Research
*WORK SCHEDULE:** Days
*WORK TYPE:** Full Time
*JOB SUMMARY:**
Geisinger Health System?s Neuroscience Institute is seeking early-career investigators with a strong background in computational intelligence as well as a creative and innovative approach to applied data analytics for a position as an early career investigator with its newly-developed Mathematical and Computational Neurosciences Research Group. This group will be directed by a clinical neurosurgeon with academic interest and experience in data science and predictive analytics who is tasked with developing novel methods to use complex, integrated healthcare datasets to individualize and to optimize the care of patients with neurologic disease. The team will work collaboratively on joint projects and will leverage the unique talents of its individual members to develop data models that can be directly and promptly implemented in a clinical setting to improve patient care.

The group will be based at Geisinger?s newly-developed Center for High Performance Medical Computing. In addition to individual high-performance workstations, the investigator will have unencumbered access to a new computational cluster with 384 CPU cores / 32 GPUs / 2.2 TB RAM running RedHat LINUX and a high-performance storage server with 248TB of disk storage running Hadoop and SQL databases over a GPFS file system. Matlab and Matlab DCS are deployed on this cluster, as are most other standard scientific and mathematical computing software packages.

As a member of the Mathematical and Computational Neurosciences Research Group, the investigator (and the remainder of the team) will be supported by a scientific programmer dedicated to the operations of the research group as well as by a computational cluster administrator and a database programmer who are dedicated full-time to the Center for High Performance Medical Computing. These resources will prevent the investigator from having to spend valuable time performing system administration or routine programming tasks and will instead allow their unique skills to be focused exclusively on the research group?s academic mission of investigation and development.

The projects that the group will undertake will involve using heterogeneous, large-volume databases (including clinical, imaging, molecular, and economic data) in conjunction with current and novel predictive analytics methods to individualize the delivery of healthcare, to optimize patient management strategies, to provide data-driven decision support to clinicians treating patients with neurologic disease, and to address challenges associated with efficiency of the process of healthcare delivery on an institutional level. The machine learning / computational intelligence investigator will focus specifically on building algorithms that are capable of learning and improving in response to the real-time data stream that is continuously generated during the routine course of clinical practice in a large academic medical center.

As an integral part of the research team who is critical to the hypothesis generation and innovation processes, the investigator will also have opportunities to interface with the clinical / patient care environment. The investigator will be encouraged to attend tumor boards, outpatient clinics, and selected inpatient medical and surgical activities in order to better understand the nature of the questions needing to be addressed and of the environment in which the models and tools developed by the group will be implemented.

Considerable emphasis is placed on practical implementation of the strategies, tools, and techniques developed by the group, making this more than just a traditional academic research engagement. While publications, presentations, and other standard research metrics will be part of the ongoing assessment of the investigator?s performance, significant value will also be placed on the practical utility and successful clinical implementation of the models and tools developed by the group. Together, these characteristics represent a unique opportunity for a machine learning investigator with a strong interest in real-world medical applications of data science.

This position reports directly to the clinician / data scientist who serves in the dual roles of (1) director of the Mathematical and Computational Neurosciences Research Group, and (2) co-director of the Center for High-Performance Medical Computing.
*COMPETENCIES AND SKILLS:**
? Proficiency with the theory and applications of common machine learning and computational intelligence algorithms, strategies, and methods

? Proficiency with coding machine learning / computational intelligence applications in common mathematical / scientific computing languages (e.g. Matlab, R)

? Proficiency with predictive analytic methods, including data modeling and regression methods

? Experience writing and publishing academic manuscripts in domain-relevant journals

? Fluency in writing and speaking the English language

We dont try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we dont hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline in terms they can understand why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. Were not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but heres a suggestion if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.

Clarity Insights is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer. We believe in treating each employee and applicant for employment fairly and with dignity.
