    "# Simple Classification Model with SVM\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "Build a classification mode using svm which can be used to predict the job title based on the skill set\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "1. Normalize title and skill fields\n",
    "2. Vectorize skill\n",
    "3. Label encode titles\n",
    "4. Create SVM model and train the model\n",
    "5. Make prediction: Vectorize skillset and use it as an input to the model, inverse transform the result into human readable text\n",

    "## Method Used\n",
    "* Support Vector Machine  \n",
    "* Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "* Prediction works as expected\n",
    "* Cross validation score isn't good enough since the job titles in the data are not normalized enough"
