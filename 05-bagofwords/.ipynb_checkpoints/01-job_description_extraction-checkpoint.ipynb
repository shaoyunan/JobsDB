With a single photograph of Earth, like the famous \"Blue Marble\" from Apollo 17, the entire world can fit on a computer screen. However, with this image you would not be able to see much detail.

Using convolutional neural networks, we have counted over 3 billion cars across global roads and parking lots, analyzing commercial patterns as well as city growth and development. Our global energy product uses computer vision to map floating roof oil tanks and measure the global volumes of crude oil. With this product, we were able to show that China has 200 million barrels of oil storage capacity that was unknown even to the trading community.
